# AE1website-design
This is the github repository for submitting the AE2 portion of the assignment. It is a digital CV/portfolio for my Web Development skills. The website is a single, static page with 6 different sections covering the different relevent fields of information. The website is live and can be found at the following URL

The website can be found at: https://adamelsbury.github.io/AE1website-design/pages/portfolio.html

The High Fidelity wireframes can be found at: https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/8ff421e14134919

The Google HTML/CSS style guide has been adhered to for the project and can be found below;

The Git branching strategy is as follows;

1.	Create initial central repository containing website sections
2.	Stage files ready to commit 
3.	Commit changes and save with comments
4.	Push to the central repository
5.	Review changes and revert to stage 2


I decided not to add another breakpoint in a media query for tablets because the text and images and columns are all responsive and I feel the layout looks fine. When I tested a 2 column tablet mode the content inside the divs had to be much larger and affected my UI design.
