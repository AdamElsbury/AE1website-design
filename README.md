# AE1website-design
This is the github repository for submitting the AE2 portion of the assignment. It is a digital CV/portfolio for my Web Development skills. The website is a single, static page with 6 different sections covering the different relevent fields of information. The website is live and can be found at the following URL

The Google HTML/CSS style guide has been adhered to for the project and can be found below;

The Git branching strategy is as follows;

1	Create initial central repository containing website sections
2	Stage files ready to commit 
3	Commit changes and save with comments
4	Push to the central repository
5	Review changes and revert to stage 2
